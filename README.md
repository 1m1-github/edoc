# edoc
Every doc issued by any institution should contain a link as a qr code to a copy of the same doc on a trusted server

idea

whenever an institution is asked to provide a doc, the doc should be created digitally and hosted on a trusted server

the recipient of the doc is given the link to the doc

the doc should include a qr code encoding the same link

this allows any verifier to follow the link, check that the linked copy is identical to the copy in question and trust the doc if the link lies on a trusted server

this simple concept allows entire bureaucracies and systems to trust in docs sent to each other

think of rentors sending payslips to landlords, potential employees sending certificates to companies, any attestation by anyone

in lieu of blockchain tech, a simple link on the doc to a trusted server solves the entire problem very effectively
